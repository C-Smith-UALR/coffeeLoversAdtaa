python manage.py makemigrations  
//will create a file in my_app/migrations directory  

python manage.py migrate  
//will run migration  

pip freeze  
//will display list of packages  
  

### Notes
- in html it is acceptable to use 2 or 4 spaces for indentation just be consistent  
- some other helpful stuff here that I forgot about

### Git
git add -u  
//stages modifications and deletions, without new files  

git add .  
//stages new files and modifications, without deletions  

git add -A  
stages all changes (equivalent to both of the above one-liners)  

git reset -- filename  
//will unstage file filename  

git rm filename  
//will remove file, assuming already removed locally
